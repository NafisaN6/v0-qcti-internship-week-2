## Deployment Steps
1. I started with v0.app to generate the initial Next.js project   
2. I then pushed code to GitHub
3. After making the project, I made some manual changes to improve the structure and accessibility within the website.  
4. I connected GitHub repo to Vercel and deployed the app via default Vercel build

## Authentication
I used help from the AI in order to create the authentication page for the sign in.  
I chose this option because it provided a quick and secure way to implement authentication without building a backend from scratch.

## v0.app Prompt & Changes
**Prompt used in v0.app:**
Create me an app about informing parents key parenting tips and styles named "PreParenting" and Build the Sign In / Sign Up screens without a real backend; show form validation and friendly error states.


**Changes I made afterward:**
- Refactored `Navbar` component to remove the duplicated links 
- Improved accessibility: added semantic HTML and alt text  
- Cleaned `page.tsx`: removed unnecessary wrapper div, improved component structure  
- Ensured all interactive elements (buttons/links) are keyboard-friendly and readable  
- Renamed components clearly and removed unused CSS/classes
